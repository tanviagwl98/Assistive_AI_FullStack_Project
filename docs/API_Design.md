# My Marriage
## REST API Design Document

**Version:** V1  
**Architecture:** Modular Monolith  
**Backend:** Next.js Route Handlers + Node.js  
**API Style:** REST  
**Authentication:** Custom server-side sessions  
**Validation:** Zod  
**Database:** MongoDB Atlas + Mongoose  
**Status:** API Design Baseline

---

# 1. Purpose

This document defines the REST API design for ** My Marriage V1**.

It covers:

- API conventions
- Authentication
- Authorization
- Request and response structures
- Error format
- Pagination
- Filtering
- Wedding APIs
- Member-management APIs
- Event APIs
- Task APIs
- Guest APIs
- Invitation and RSVP APIs
- Expense APIs
- Vendor APIs
- Wedding website APIs
- Gallery and photo APIs
- Livestream APIs
- Background email APIs
- Internal cron APIs

The API layer should remain thin.

The general request flow is:

```text
HTTP Request
    ↓
Route Handler
    ↓
Authentication
    ↓
Authorization
    ↓
Zod Validation
    ↓
Service Layer
    ↓
Mongoose / External Provider
    ↓
HTTP Response
```

---

# 2. API Design Xples

## 2.1 Explicit REST APIs

Even though frontend and backend live inside the same Next.js application, major application operations should use explicit backend endpoints.

This gives us:

- Clear frontend/backend boundaries
- Easier testing
- Easier debugging
- Better security review
- Potential future mobile-client compatibility
- Clearer educational architecture

---

## 2.2 Thin Route Handlers

Route handlers should not contain major business logic.

Example:

```text
POST /api/tasks
```

should roughly:

```text
Authenticate
↓
Resolve Wedding
↓
Validate Body
↓
TaskService.createTask(...)
↓
Return Response
```

The route should not directly implement every business rule.

---

## 2.3 Wedding Context Comes From Authentication

For private APIs, do not trust:

```text
weddingId
```

sent by the client.

The backend determines the current Wedding through:

```text
Session
   ↓
User
   ↓
Wedding Membership
   ↓
Wedding
```

Therefore private requests generally do not contain `weddingId`.

---

# 3. API Base Path

All application APIs use:

```text
/api
```

Example:

```text
/api/auth/login
/api/events
/api/guests
```

No `/api/v1` prefix is required initially.

If a public external API is introduced later, explicit versioning can be added then.

---

# 4. API Surface Categories

There are four categories.

```text
/api/auth/*
```

Authentication endpoints.

```text
/api/*
```

Authenticated Wedding Member APIs.

```text
/api/public/*
```

Unauthenticated public/token-protected APIs.

```text
/api/internal/*
```

System-only APIs such as cron processing.

---

# 5. HTTP Method Conventions

Use:

```text
GET
```

Read data.

```text
POST
```

Create a resource or trigger an action.

```text
PATCH
```

Partially update a resource.

```text
DELETE
```

Delete/archive a resource.

We will generally avoid `PUT` because most application updates are partial.

---

# 6. Successful Response Format

For individual resources:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "...": "..."
  }
}
```

For collections:

```json
{
  "data": [
    {},
    {}
  ],
  "pagination": {
    "page": 1,
    "limit": 50,
    "total": 186,
    "totalPages": 4
  }
}
```

For action endpoints where no resource needs returning:

```json
{
  "success": true
}
```

---

# 7. Error Response Format

All APIs should use a consistent error structure.

Example:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "VALIDATION_ERROR",
    "message": "Invalid request data",
    "details": {
      "email": "Invalid email address"
    }
  }
}
```

---

# 8. Standard Error Codes

Recommended application codes:

```text
VALIDATION_ERROR

UNAUTHENTICATED

FORBIDDEN

NOT_FOUND

CONFLICT

INVALID_TOKEN

TOKEN_EXPIRED

RATE_LIMITED

UPLOAD_ERROR

EXTERNAL_SERVICE_ERROR

INTERNAL_ERROR
```

Business-specific codes may additionally exist.

Examples:

```text
EMAIL_ALREADY_EXISTS

ALREADY_HAS_WEDDING

LAST_ADMIN

GUEST_LIMIT_EXCEEDED

INVITATION_ALREADY_ACCEPTED
```

---

# 9. HTTP Status Codes

Use normal HTTP semantics.

```text
200 OK
```

Successful read/update/action.

```text
201 Created
```

Resource created.

```text
204 No Content
```

Successful deletion where response body is unnecessary.

```text
400 Bad Request
```

Malformed/invalid input.

```text
401 Unauthorized
```

No valid authentication session.

```text
403 Forbidden
```

Authenticated but insufficient permission.

```text
404 Not Found
```

Resource unavailable or inaccessible.

```text
409 Conflict
```

Business-state conflict.

```text
429 Too Many Requests
```

Rate limit exceeded.

```text
500 Internal Server Error
```

Unexpected application error.

```text
502/503
```

May be used when an external provider is temporarily unavailable.

---

# 10. Authentication Cookie

After signup/login, backend sets a secure cookie.

Example conceptual name:

```text
mmm_session
```

Properties:

```text
HttpOnly
Secure in production
SameSite=Lax
Path=/
```

The frontend should not access the token using JavaScript.

Browser automatically sends the cookie with authenticated requests.

---

# 11. Authentication APIs

## POST `/api/auth/signup`

Creates an account and authenticated session.

### Request

```json
{
  "name": "Tanvi Saini",
  "email": "tanvi@example.com",
  "password": "strong-password"
}
```

### Behaviour

```text
Validate input
↓
Normalize email
↓
Check duplicate account
↓
Hash password
↓
Create User
↓
Create Session
↓
Set Cookie
```

### Response

```json
{
  "data": {
    "user": {
      "id": "userId",
      "name": "Tanvi Agarwal",
      "email": "tanvi@example.com"
    },
    "hasWedding": false
  }
}
```

### Errors

```text
VALIDATION_ERROR
EMAIL_ALREADY_EXISTS
```

No email verification occurs.

---

# 12. Login

## POST `/api/auth/login`

### Request

```json
{
  "email": "tanvi@example.com",
  "password": "password"
}
```

### Response

```json
{
  "data": {
    "user": {
      "id": "userId",
      "name": "Tanvi Saini",
      "email": "tanvi@example.com"
    },
    "hasWedding": true
  }
}
```

Backend sets session cookie.

Invalid credentials should return a generic message.

Avoid:

```text
"This email exists but password is wrong."
```

Prefer:

```text
"Invalid email or password."
```

---

# 13. Logout

## POST `/api/auth/logout`

Requires authentication.

### Behaviour

```text
Delete/invalidate session
↓
Clear cookie
```

### Response

```json
{
  "success": true
}
```

---

# 14. Current User

## GET `/api/auth/me`

Returns current authenticated user and Wedding membership information.

### Response

```json
{
  "data": {
    "user": {
      "id": "userId",
      "name": "Tanvi Saini",
      "email": "tanvi@example.com"
    },
    "membership": {
      "role": "ADMIN"
    },
    "wedding": {
      "id": "weddingId",
      "brideName": "X",
      "groomName": "Tanvi",
      "weddingDate": "2027-02-14"
    }
  }
}
```

If user does not yet belong to a Wedding:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "user": {
      "id": "userId",
      "name": "Tanvi Saini",
      "email": "tanvi@example.com"
    },
    "membership": null,
    "wedding": null
  }
}
```

---

# 15. Forgot Password

## POST `/api/auth/forgot-password`

### Request

```json
{
  "email": "tanvi@example.com"
}
```

### Response

Always return a generic success response:

```json
{
  "success": true
}
```

Do not reveal whether the account exists.

If account exists:

```text
Generate Reset Token
↓
Store Token Hash
↓
Send Email through Resend
```

---

# 16. Reset Password

## POST `/api/auth/reset-password`

### Request

```json
{
  "token": "raw-reset-token",
  "password": "new-password"
}
```

### Response

{
  "success": true
}
```

### Possible Errors

```text
INVALID_TOKEN

VALIDATION_ERROR
```

---

# 17. Wedding Creation

## POST `/api/wedding`

Authentication required.

Only users without an existing Wedding Membership can use this endpoint.

### Request

```json
{
  "brideName": "X",
  "groomName": "Tanvi",
  "title": "Tanvi & X",
  "description": "We are getting married!",
  "weddingDate": "2027-02-14",
  "timeZone": "Asia/Kolkata",
  "location": {
    "formattedAddress": "Dehradun, Uttarakhand, India",
    "city": "Dehradun",
    "state": "Uttarakhand",
    "country": "India",
    "latitude": 30.3165,
    "longitude": 78.0322,
    "googlePlaceId": "..."
  }
}
```

### Behaviour

Atomically:

```text
Create Wedding
+
Create ADMIN Wedding Membership
```

Also generate:

```text
website.slug
gallery token
```

### Response

```json
{
  "data": {
    "id": "weddingId",
    "brideName": "X",
    "groomName": "Tanvi",
    "weddingDate": "2027-02-14",
    "website": {
      "slug": "X-tanvi-14022027"
    }
  }
}
```

### Errors

```text
ALREADY_HAS_WEDDING
VALIDATION_ERROR
```

---

# 18. Get Wedding

## GET `/api/wedding`

Authentication required.

Returns current Wedding.

### Response

```json
{
  "data": {
    "id": "weddingId",
    "brideName": "X",
    "groomName": "Tanvi",
    "title": "Tanvi & X",
    "description": "...",
    "weddingDate": "2027-02-14",
    "timeZone": "Asia/Kolkata",
    "location": {},
    "website": {},
    "gallery": {
      "isEnabled": true,
      "guestUploadsEnabled": true
    },
    "livestream": {
      "youtubeUrl": null,
      "isEnabled": false
    }
  }
}
```

Do not return secret token hashes.

---

# 19. Update Wedding

## PATCH `/api/wedding`

Authentication required.

Admin and Manager allowed.

### Request

Any subset:

```json
{
  "brideName": "X",
  "groomName": "Tanvi",
  "description": "Updated welcome message",
  "weddingDate": "2027-02-14",
  "location": {
    "...": "..."
  }
}
```

Existing wedding slug should remain unchanged when names/date change.

---

# 20. Wedding Dashboard

## GET `/api/dashboard`

Authentication required.

Returns aggregated dashboard information.

### Response

```json
{
  "data": {
    "countdown": {
      "weddingDate": "2027-02-14",
      "daysRemaining": 42
    },
    "summary": {
      "events": 6,
      "tasks": {
        "total": 48,
        "completed": 32
      },
      "guests": 186,
      "rsvps": {
        "pending": 54,
        "attending": 120,
        "notAttending": 12
      },
      "totalExpensePaise": 124500000,
      "vendors": 8
    },
    "upcomingEvents": [],
    "upcomingTasks": []
  }
}
```

The dashboard endpoint is intentionally an aggregation endpoint.

This is preferable to requiring the frontend to make 8 independent requests.

---

# 21. Wedding Members

## GET `/api/members`

Authentication required.

Admin and Manager can view members.

### Response

```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "membershipId": "...",
      "user": {
        "id": "...",
        "name": "Tanvi Saini",
        "email": "tanvi@example.com"
      },
      "role": "ADMIN",
      "joinedAt": "..."
    }
  ]
}
```

---

# 22. Invite Wedding Member

## POST `/api/members/invitations`

**Admin only.**

### Request

```json
{
  "email": "rahul@example.com",
  "role": "MANAGER"
}
```

### Behaviour

```text
Check Admin
↓
Normalize Email
↓
Ensure not already member
↓
Ensure no pending duplicate invite
↓
Create secure invitation token
↓
Create invitation record
↓
Send email immediately through Resend
```

### Response

```json
{
  "data": {
    "id": "invitationId",
    "email": "rahul@example.com",
    "role": "MANAGER",
    "status": "PENDING",
    "expiresAt": "..."
  }
}
```

---

# 23. List Pending Member Invitations

## GET `/api/members/invitations`

Admin only.

Returns pending invitations for the current Wedding.

---

# 24. Revoke Member Invitation

## DELETE `/api/members/invitations/:invitationId`

Admin only.

Marks invitation:

```text
REVOKED
```

rather than necessarily deleting it.

---

# 25. Get Public Member Invitation

## GET `/api/public/member-invitations/:token`

No authentication required.

Returns enough information to render the invitation page.

### Response

```json
{
  "data": {
    "email": "rahul@example.com",
    "role": "MANAGER",
    "wedding": {
      "brideName": "X",
      "groomName": "Tanvi",
      "weddingDate": "2027-02-14"
    },
    "requiresLogin": true
  }
}
```

Do not expose internal Wedding information unnecessarily.

---

# 26. Accept Wedding Member Invitation

## POST `/api/member-invitations/:token/accept`

Authentication required.

### Behaviour

```text
Validate invitation
↓
Validate current user's normalized email matches invitation email
↓
Ensure user has no membership
↓
Create membership
↓
Mark invitation ACCEPTED
```

### Response

```json
{
  "data": {
    "weddingId": "...",
    "role": "MANAGER"
  }
}
```

### Errors

```text
INVALID_TOKEN
TOKEN_EXPIRED
INVITATION_ALREADY_ACCEPTED
ALREADY_HAS_WEDDING
INVITATION_EMAIL_MISMATCH
```

---

# 27. Change Member Role

## PATCH `/api/members/:membershipId`

Admin only.

### Request

```json
{
  "role": "ADMIN"
}
```

or:

```json
{
  "role": "MANAGER"
}
```

Backend must ensure Wedding never ends with zero Admins.

---

# 28. Remove Wedding Member

## DELETE `/api/members/:membershipId`

Admin only.

### Possible Errors

```text
LAST_ADMIN
NOT_FOUND
FORBIDDEN
```

Successful removal immediately invalidates Wedding access for that User.

Existing auth session itself may remain valid, but `/api/auth/me` will then show no Wedding membership.

---

# 29. Events

## GET `/api/events`

Authentication required.

### Query Parameters

```text
includeArchived=false
```

Optional:

```text
from
to
```

### Response

```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "id": "...",
      "name": "Mehendi",
      "type": "MEHENDI",
      "startsAt": "...",
      "endsAt": "...",
      "venueName": "Royal Garden",
      "address": "...",
      "dressCode": "Green / Traditional"
    }
  ]
}
```

Default ordering:

```text
startsAt ASC
```

---

# 30. Create Event

## POST `/api/events`

Authentication required.

Implementation notes (2026-09-16): Admins and Managers are allowed. `name` and
`startsAt` are required; `type` is optional, matching the database design.
Optional text fields can be cleared with an empty string, and `endsAt` with null.
Timestamps must be ISO date-times with an explicit offset (including Z). If
present, the end must be strictly after the start. Cover uploads are deferred.


### Request

```json
{
  "name": "Mehendi",
  "type": "MEHENDI",
  "startsAt": "2027-02-12T10:30:00.000Z",
  "endsAt": "2027-02-12T14:30:00.000Z",
  "venueName": "Royal Garden",
  "address": "Dehradun",
  "description": "...",
  "dressCode": "Green / Traditional"
}
```

### Response

```text
201 Created
```

with created Event.

---

# 31. Get Event

## GET `/api/events/:eventId`

Authentication required.

Backend queries using:

```text
_id + currentWeddingId
```

---

# 32. Update Event

## PATCH `/api/events/:eventId`

Authentication required.

Allows partial updates.

The resulting start/end pair is validated after merging changes. Archived events
are read-only. A concurrent modification detected during the update returns
CONFLICT; reload the event before retrying. Client-supplied wedding IDs are rejected.


---

# 33. Archive Event

## DELETE `/api/events/:eventId`

Authentication required.

This does not physically delete the Event.

Instead:

```text
archivedAt = now
```

### Response

```json
{
  "success": true
}
```

---

# 34. Tasks

## GET `/api/tasks`

Authentication required.

### Supported Query Parameters

```text
page
limit

status
priority
eventId
assignedMembershipId
mine=true
```

Example:

```text
GET /api/tasks?status=TODO&mine=true&page=1&limit=50
```

### Implemented V1 behaviour (2026-09-16)

- Admins and Managers have the same task permissions. Wedding scope comes from
  authenticated membership. Missing or cross-wedding resources return `NOT_FOUND`.
- The list response uses `{ data, pagination: { page, limit, total, totalPages } }`.
  Page defaults to 1 (maximum 100000); limit defaults to 20 (maximum 100).
  Ordering is newest creation first, with ID as a stable tie-breaker.
- `mine=true` means the caller's current membership ID; `mine=false` disables it.
  Filters combine with AND. A conflicting explicit assignee and `mine=true`
  produce no matches. `eventId=none` selects general wedding tasks, and
  `assignedMembershipId=none` selects unassigned tasks.
- Responses include task fields and nullable `assignee` (membership ID, name,
  role) and `event` (ID, name, archivedAt) summaries. No user email is exposed.


---

# 35. Create Task

## POST `/api/tasks`

### Request

```json
{
  "title": "Finalize photographer",
  "description": "Confirm final package",
  "assignedMembershipId": "...",
  "eventId": "...",
  "dueDate": "2026-09-15T00:00:00.000Z",
  "priority": "HIGH",
  "status": "TODO"
}
```

Backend validates:

```text
assignedMembership belongs to current Wedding
event belongs to current Wedding
```

Title is required (trimmed, maximum 200 characters). Description is optional
(maximum 2000); priority defaults to `MEDIUM`, status to `TODO`. Optional member,
event, and due date can be omitted or set to null. New associations require a
current member and an active event in the wedding. Existing archived-event or
removed-member references remain visible and can be retained or cleared on edit.
The UI labels a missing assignee as “Former member”.

Due dates use ISO instants in the API and MongoDB. The date-only UI converts
midnight in the wedding timezone to UTC; overdue means an incomplete task whose
wedding-local due date is before today. Unchanged timestamps retain precision.
Creating an already completed task sets `completedAt` on the server.


---

# 36. Get Task

## GET `/api/tasks/:taskId`

Authentication required.

---

# 37. Update Task

## PATCH `/api/tasks/:taskId`

Example:

```json
{
  "status": "COMPLETED"
}
```

If status becomes `COMPLETED`:

```text
completedAt = now
```

If moved away from `COMPLETED`:

```text
completedAt = null
```

Metadata edits to an already completed task preserve its completion timestamp.
The body must contain at least one supported field; wedding ownership and
`completedAt` cannot be supplied by callers. An atomic version check returns
`CONFLICT` if another write occurs between the service read and update.


---

# 38. Delete Task

## DELETE `/api/tasks/:taskId`

Authentication required.

Hard deletion.

---

# 39. Guests

## GET `/api/guests`

Authentication required.

Paginated.

### Query Parameters

```text
page
limit

search
rsvpStatus
eventId
invitationSent
```

Example:

```text
/api/guests?search=sharma&rsvpStatus=PENDING&page=1&limit=50
```

### Search

Initial search can match:

```text
name
email
phone
```

Do not introduce Elasticsearch.

---

### Implemented guest CRUD behaviour (2026-09-16)

- Admins and Managers have equal guest-management permissions. Wedding scope
  comes from authenticated membership; missing/cross-wedding resources return
  `NOT_FOUND`. IDs, bodies, and query parameters use strict validation.
- Lists return `{ data, pagination: { page, limit, total, totalPages } }`.
  Page defaults to 1 (maximum 100000), limit to 20 (maximum 100). Order by name,
  then ID for stable pagination. Search is a literal, case-insensitive match on
  name/email/phone, up to 120 characters; regex metacharacters are escaped.
- RSVP/event filters and `invitationSent=true|false` combine with AND. The current
  UI offers search, event, and read-only RSVP filters; no delivery actions.
- Required name: trimmed, 1–120 characters. Optional email: valid address or empty,
  maximum 254 characters. Optional phone: up to 40 characters using digits and
  common phone punctuation. Optional notes: up to 2000 characters.
- `maxGuests` defaults to 1 and must be an integer from 1 to 10000, including the
  named guest. `invitedEventIds` defaults to an empty array, with at most 100 unique
  valid event IDs. Requests also retain the shared 8 KiB JSON body limit.
- New event associations require active events in the same wedding. Previously
  associated archived/unavailable events can be retained or removed during editing.
  Guests may be created with an empty selection, including when no active events exist.
- Email is normalized for searching, with no uniqueness constraint: shared family
  addresses are permitted. Optional contact/notes fields can be cleared using an
  empty string; event selections can be cleared with `[]`.
- Guest responses include the public guest fields and `invitedEvents` summaries
  (ID, name, start, archive date). Invitation secrets and normalized-email internals
  are excluded. A new guest has `PENDING` RSVP and null attendance/delivery dates.
- Updates are partial, reject server-owned RSVP/token/delivery/ownership fields,
  preserve existing RSVP and stable tokens, and reject capacity below recorded
  attendance. Version and atomic capacity guards reject concurrent conflicts.
- Deletion is permanent. Guest EmailJobs do not exist in this increment; their
  cancellation must accompany the later delivery feature, as required below.
- Dashboard totals count guest records as groups and sum maximum party sizes as
  capacity. Neither number represents invitations sent or confirmed attendance.

---

# 40. Create Guest

## POST `/api/guests`

### Request

```json
{
  "name": "Rajesh Sharma",
  "email": "rajesh@example.com",
  "phone": "+919876543210",
  "maxGuests": 4,
  "invitedEventIds": [
    "event1",
    "event2"
  ],
  "notes": "Family friend"
}
```

### Behaviour

Backend:

```text
validates event IDs
↓
generates stable invitation token
↓
stores token with default selection disabled
↓
creates Guest
```

### Response

Should not normally return raw invitation token except when specifically needed for a sharing action.

---

# 41. Get Guest

## GET `/api/guests/:guestId`

Authentication required.

### Response

May include invitation-related information such as:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "id": "...",
    "name": "Rajesh Sharma",
    "email": "rajesh@example.com",
    "phone": "...",
    "maxGuests": 4,
    "invitedEvents": [],
    "rsvpStatus": "ATTENDING",
    "attendingCount": 3,
    "invitationSentAt": "...",
    "lastReminderSentAt": "..."
  }
}
```

---

# 42. Update Guest

## PATCH `/api/guests/:guestId`

Allows updates to:

```text
name
email
phone
maxGuests
invitedEventIds
notes
```

If `maxGuests` is reduced below an existing `attendingCount`, reject the request or require explicit correction.

Do not silently create inconsistent RSVP state.

---

# 43. Delete Guest

## DELETE `/api/guests/:guestId`

Authentication required.

Hard deletes Guest.

Also cancel pending EmailJobs related to that Guest.

Invitation link immediately becomes invalid.

---

# 44. Guest Invitation Sharing URL

### Accepted V1 stable-sharing decision

Generate a cryptographically random, high-entropy `invitationToken` when creating
the Guest and store it in that document. This lets organisers repeatedly retrieve
the same invitation URL in the sharing increment. Use 32 random bytes encoded
as base64url and a unique index. Exclude the secret from default model reads,
ordinary CRUD projections, logs, and errors.

This is the deliberate exception to token hashing for shareable guest links.
It supersedes the earlier hash-only guest recommendation. Session, password-reset,
and member invitation tokens retain their existing HMAC-SHA-256 hashing rules.
Gallery tokens follow the separate stable-sharing decision in their own feature.

The initial Guest Management increment creates the secret but exposes no sharing
endpoint, public invitation page, email delivery, or RSVP submission. Guest CRUD
never returns the raw token. Later sharing retrieves the existing secret rather
than rotating it on each request. Deleting its owner invalidates any future link.

As of 2026-09-16, link retrieval, public invitation viewing, RSVP submission, and
RSVP summaries (§45, §50–52) are implemented. Guest email delivery, bulk actions
and reminders (§46–49) remain deferred. Copy/open actions do not mark emails sent.

# 45. Get Guest Invitation Link

## GET `/api/guests/:guestId/invitation-link`

Authentication required. Admin or Manager membership is required; the guest lookup
uses the membership’s wedding ID. Cross-wedding or missing guests return 404.
The stable URL uses the configured `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` origin, never the request
Host header. Responses are private and not cached. UI supports copy (with a manual
fallback) and open-in-new-tab; sharing via other apps is manual.

### Response

```json
{
  "data": {
    "url": "https://makemymarriage.com/invite/abc123..."
  }
}
```

Used for:

- Copy Link
- WhatsApp Share

---

# 46. Send One Guest Invitation

## POST `/api/guests/:guestId/send-invitation`

Authentication required.

Guest must have email.

### Behaviour

```text
Load Guest
↓
Build Stable Invitation URL
↓
Send through Resend immediately
↓
Update invitationSentAt
```

### Response

```json
{
  "success": true
}
```

---

# 47. Send Bulk Guest Invitations

## POST `/api/guests/actions/send-invitations`

Authentication required.

### Request

Option A:

```json
{
  "guestIds": [
    "...",
    "..."
  ]
}
```

Option B:

```json
{
  "filter": {
    "invitationSent": false
  }
}
```

For MVP I recommend supporting **explicit guest IDs plus a simple preset action** rather than building arbitrary query serialization.

Example:

```json
{
  "scope": "ALL_UNSENT"
}
```

Possible scopes:

```text
ALL_UNSENT
ALL_PENDING_RSVP
SELECTED
```

If:

```text
SELECTED
```

then:

```json
{
  "scope": "SELECTED",
  "guestIds": ["...", "..."]
}
```

### Behaviour

Create EmailJobs.

### Response

```json
{
  "data": {
    "batchId": "batch-id",
    "jobsCreated": 437
  }
}
```

---

# 48. Send RSVP Reminder to One Guest

## POST `/api/guests/:guestId/send-reminder`

Authentication required.

Guest must:

```text
have email
AND
rsvpStatus = PENDING
```

Send immediately through Resend.

Update:

```text
lastReminderSentAt
reminderCount
```

---

# 49. Bulk RSVP Reminders

## POST `/api/guests/actions/send-reminders`

Authentication required.

Typical request:

```json
{
  "scope": "ALL_PENDING_RSVP"
}
```

Creates asynchronous EmailJobs.

---

# 50. Public Guest Invitation

## GET `/api/public/invitations/:token`

No login.

### Behaviour

```text
Validate token
↓
Resolve Guest
↓
Resolve Wedding
↓
Load only active invited Events from the same Wedding
↓
Return invitation data
```

### Response

```json
{
  "data": {
    "guest": {
      "name": "Rajesh Sharma",
      "maxGuests": 4,
      "rsvpStatus": "PENDING",
      "attendingCount": null
    },
    "wedding": {
      "brideName": "X",
      "groomName": "Tanvi",
      "weddingDate": "2027-02-14",
      "timeZone": "Asia/Kolkata",
      "title": "Our celebration",
      "location": "Jaipur, Rajasthan, India"
    },
    "events": [
      {
        "name": "Wedding",
        "startsAt": "...",
        "endsAt": null,
        "venueName": "...",
        "address": "...",
        "dressCode": "...",
        "description": "..."
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Do not expose:

```text
other guests
expenses
vendors
members
internal notes
```

---

### Implemented public boundary (2026-09-16)

`/invite/:token` is a standalone page with no login requirement. Both it and this
API use generic unavailable states for malformed, missing, or deleted invitations;
a deleted wedding also makes the link unavailable. The API returns 404.
Only the explicit fields above are exposed: no database IDs, contact details,
internal notes, other guests, members, or unrelated sharing tokens. Events are
filtered by owner wedding, invitation event IDs, and `archivedAt: null`.
The approved floral artwork is a local decorative asset; cover uploads are deferred.
Responses are no-store; public routes have no-referrer and noindex headers/metadata.
Token-bearing routes are excluded from Next application incoming request logging.
The UI retains unsaved RSVP choices after retryable failures and refreshes on focus
or cross-tab signals. No response deadline or invitation expiry is introduced.

---

# 51. Submit RSVP

## POST `/api/public/invitations/:token/rsvp`

No authentication.

Rate limited: a shared ceiling of 300 submissions/minute and 20 submissions per
invitation per 15-minute fixed window. Counters reuse the existing MongoDB rate
limit mechanism with HMAC-derived keys; raw invitation secrets are not stored in
counter IDs. Malformed input and disallowed origins are rejected before counters.
The invitation service resolves an existing guest and active wedding and validates
capacity before quota consumption. The per-invitation counter is consumed first;
only attempts admitted by it consume the shared counter. Nonexistent/deleted links
and per-invitation rejections therefore cannot exhaust the shared quota. Identical
repeat responses remain rate limited even though they do not rewrite the RSVP.
Requests use the configured application origin and strict JSON/query validation.

### Request — Attending

```json
{
  "status": "ATTENDING",
  "attendingCount": 3
}
```

### Request — Not Attending

```json
{
  "status": "NOT_ATTENDING",
  "attendingCount": 0
}
```

### Validation

```text
ATTENDING:
1 <= attendingCount <= maxGuests

NOT_ATTENDING:
attendingCount = 0
```

### Response

```json
{
  "data": {
    "status": "ATTENDING",
    "attendingCount": 3,
    "updatedAt": "..."
  }
}
```

The same endpoint may be used later to modify RSVP. One response applies to the
whole guest group. Repeating the current status/count is idempotent. Updates check
the guest version and current capacity atomically, increment `__v`, and save
`rsvpUpdatedAt`. A concurrent edit returns 409; reduced capacity returns a friendly
`PARTY_SIZE_CHANGED` validation error. The UI refreshes the invitation while
retaining the draft so the guest can review and retry.

---

# 52. RSVP Summary

## GET `/api/guests/rsvp-summary`

Authentication required.

### Response

```json
{
  "data": {
    "totalGuests": 186,
    "pendingInvitations": 54,
    "attendingInvitations": 120,
    "notAttendingInvitations": 12,
    "totalPeopleAttending": 287
  }
}
```

This separates:

```text
Number of invitations
```

from:

```text
Number of actual attendees
```

which is important because each Guest may bring multiple people.

---

# 53. Expenses

## GET `/api/expenses`

Authentication required.

Paginated.

### Query Parameters

```text
page

```

---

# 61. Add Discovered Vendor

## POST `/api/vendors/from-place`

Authentication required.

### Request

```json
{
  "googlePlaceId": "..."
}
```

Backend should fetch trusted Place information itself rather than blindly trusting client-provided vendor metadata.

### Behaviour

```text
Google Place ID
↓
Google Places Details
↓
Map supported fields
↓
Create Vendor
```

Set:

```text
source = GOOGLE_PLACES
```

---

# 62. Get Vendor

---

# 63. Update Vendor

## PATCH `/api/vendors/:vendorId`

---

# 64. Archive Vendor

```

Backend:

```text
Current Wedding Location
↓
Google Places
↓
Results
```

Or custom:

```text

      "latitude": 30.31,
      "longitude": 78.03
    }
  ]
}
```

Return only fields actually needed by our UI.

---

# 67. Wedding Website Settings

## GET `/api/wedding/website`

Authentication required.

### Response

```json
{
  "data": {
    "slug": "X-tanvi-14022027",
    "theme": "CLASSIC",
    "isPublished": false,
    "welcomeMessage": "..."
  }
}
```

---

# 68. Update Wedding Website

## PATCH `/api/wedding/website`

### Request

```json
{
  "theme": "MINIMAL",
  "welcomeMessage": "We would love to celebrate with you.",
  "isPublished": true
}
```

Do not permit arbitrary slug editing in V1.

Stable slug remains system-managed.

---

# 69. Public Wedding Website

## GET `/api/public/weddings/:slug`

No authentication.

Returns only public website information.

### Response

```json
{
  "data": {
    "brideName": "X",
    "groomName": "Tanvi",
    "title": "Tanvi & X",
    "description": "...",
    "weddingDate": "2027-02-14",
    "coverImageUrl": "...",
    "theme": "CLASSIC",
    "events": [],
    "gallery": {
      "enabled": true
    },
    "livestream": {
      "enabled": false,
      "youtubeUrl": null
    }
  }
}
```

If `isPublished = false`:

```text
404
```

is preferable to revealing unpublished wedding existence.

---

# 70. Livestream Settings

## GET `/api/wedding/livestream`

Authentication required.

---

# 71. Update Livestream

## PATCH `/api/wedding/livestream`

### Request

```json
{
  "youtubeUrl": "https://youtube.com/...",
  "isEnabled": true
}
```

Backend should validate supported YouTube URL formats.

---

# 72. Remove Livestream

Could use:

```text
PATCH /api/wedding/livestream
```

with:

```json
{
  "youtubeUrl": null,
  "isEnabled": false
}
```

No separate DELETE endpoint is necessary.

---

# 73. Gallery Settings

## GET `/api/gallery/settings`

Authentication required.

### Response

```json
{
  "data": {
    "isEnabled": true,
    "guestUploadsEnabled": true,
    "galleryUrl": "https://makemymarriage.com/gallery/...",
    "qrUrl": "https://makemymarriage.com/gallery/..."
  }
}
```

The frontend can generate/display QR using `galleryUrl`.

---

# 74. Update Gallery Settings

## PATCH `/api/gallery/settings`

### Request

```json
{
  "isEnabled": true,
  "guestUploadsEnabled": true
}
```

---

# 75. Photo List for Wedding Members

## GET `/api/photos`

Authentication required.

Use cursor pagination.

### Query Parameters

```text
eventId
cursor
limit
```

Example:

```text
/api/photos?eventId=abc&limit=50
```

### Response

```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "id": "...",
      "eventId": "...",
      "url": "...",
      "originalFilename": "...",
      "uploaderType": "GUEST",
      "createdAt": "..."
    }
  ],
  "pagination": {
    "nextCursor": "..."
  }
}
```

URLs may be:

- signed read URLs
- controlled CDN URLs

depending on final R2 delivery configuration.

---

# 76. Authenticated Photo Upload Request

## POST `/api/photos/upload-url`

Authentication required.

### Request

```json
{
  "filename": "IMG_1001.jpg",
  "mimeType": "image/jpeg",
  "sizeBytes": 5283912,
  "eventId": "..."
}
```

### Backend Validates

```text
Allowed MIME
Maximum size
Event belongs to Wedding
```

Then generates:

```text
R2 objectKey
Signed upload URL
```

### Response

```json
{
  "data": {
    "uploadUrl": "...",
    "objectKey": "weddings/.../gallery/...",
    "expiresAt": "..."
  }
}
```

---

# 77. Confirm Authenticated Photo Upload

## POST `/api/photos`

Authentication required.

Called after successful direct R2 upload.

### Request

```json
{
  "objectKey": "weddings/.../gallery/...",
  "filename": "IMG_1001.jpg",
  "mimeType": "image/jpeg",
  "sizeBytes": 5283912,
  "eventId": "..."
}
```

Backend verifies object key belongs to the current Wedding upload namespace.

Then creates Photo metadata.

---

# 78. Delete Photo

## DELETE `/api/photos/:photoId`

Authentication required.

### Behaviour

```text
Verify Wedding ownership
↓
Delete R2 object
↓
Delete Photo metadata
```

---

# 79. Public Gallery

## GET `/api/public/galleries/:token/photos`

No login.

Token-protected.

Rate limiting may be applied.

Uses cursor pagination.

### Query Parameters

```text
eventId
cursor
limit
```

Returns gallery-safe Photo objects.

---

# 80. Public Gallery Information

## GET `/api/public/galleries/:token`

Returns:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "wedding": {
      "brideName": "X",
      "groomName": "Tanvi",
      "weddingDate": "2027-02-14"
    },
    "guestUploadsEnabled": true,
    "events": [
      {
        "id": "...",
        "name": "Mehendi"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

---

# 81. Guest Photo Upload URL

## POST `/api/public/galleries/:token/upload-url`

No login.

Rate limited.

### Request

```json
{
  "filename": "photo.jpg",
  "mimeType": "image/jpeg",
  "sizeBytes": 4200000,
  "eventId": "..."
}
```

Backend:

```text
Validate gallery token
↓
Ensure gallery enabled
↓
Ensure guest uploads enabled
↓
Validate event belongs to Wedding
↓
Validate file metadata
↓
Generate short-lived signed R2 URL
```

---

# 82. Confirm Guest Upload

## POST `/api/public/galleries/:token/photos`

No login.

### Request

```json
{
  "objectKey": "...",
  "filename": "photo.jpg",
  "mimeType": "image/jpeg",
  "sizeBytes": 4200000,
  "eventId": "..."
}
```

Creates:

```text
uploaderType = GUEST
```

No moderation stage.

---

# 83. Cover Image Uploads

Wedding and Event cover images should use the same direct-upload architecture.

Potential endpoints:

```text
POST /api/wedding/cover/upload-url

POST /api/events/:eventId/cover/upload-url
```

After upload, a PATCH operation can save the resulting `objectKey`.

Example:

```json
{
  "coverImageObjectKey": "..."
}
```

We do not need an independent Media Service API for V1.

---

# 84. QR Code

No database QR entity is required.

## GET `/api/gallery/qr`

Authentication required.

Two acceptable approaches:

### Option A

Return gallery URL and let frontend generate the QR.

Preferred.

```json
{
  "data": {
    "galleryUrl": "https://makemymarriage.com/gallery/..."
  }
}
```

### Option B

Return generated SVG/PNG.

For V1 I prefer **Option A**.

It keeps backend simpler.

---

# 85. Bulk Email Batch Status

Because background emails run asynchronously, frontend needs a way to show status.

## GET `/api/email-batches/:batchId`

Authentication required.

Batch must belong to current Wedding.

### Response

```json
{
  "data": {
    "batchId": "...",
    "total": 437,
    "pending": 200,
    "processing": 30,
    "sent": 200,
    "failed": 7,
    "cancelled": 0,
    "completed": false
  }
}
```

No separate `email_batches` collection is required.

Aggregation can use `EmailJob.batchId`.

---

# 86. Retry Failed Email Batch Jobs

Optional but useful:

## POST `/api/email-batches/:batchId/retry-failed`

Authentication required.

Creates retry eligibility for jobs in:

```text
FAILED
```

subject to retry policy.

This may be deferred if the initial UI does not expose retry controls.

---

# 87. Internal Email Worker

## POST `/api/internal/jobs/email`

Not accessible to normal users.

Called by Vercel Cron.

Authentication uses internal Cron secret.

### Flow

```text
Validate Internal Secret
↓
Recover stale PROCESSING jobs
↓
Claim pending jobs atomically
↓
Process small batch
↓
Send via Resend
↓
Mark SENT / Retry / FAILED
```

### Response

```json
{
  "data": {
    "claimed": 50,
    "sent": 47,
    "failed": 3
  }
}
```

Do not expose this route publicly without authentication.

---

# 88. API Pagination

Two pagination strategies will be used.

---

# 89. Page-Based Pagination

Use for manageable admin datasets such as:

```text
Guests
Tasks
Expenses
Vendors
```

Parameters:

```text
page=1
limit=50
```

Limits should have an upper bound.

Example:

```text
maximum limit = 100
```

---

# 90. Cursor Pagination

Use for Photo Gallery because the number of photos can grow significantly and infinite scrolling is likely.

Example:

```text
GET /api/photos?cursor=abc&limit=50
```

Response:

```json
{
  "data": [],
  "pagination": {
    "nextCursor": "xyz"
  }
}
```

Cursor should represent ordering around:

```text
createdAt
_id
```

and remain opaque to clients.

---

# 91. Filtering Conventions

Use query parameters for collection filtering.

Examples:

```text
/api/tasks?status=TODO

/api/tasks?eventId=123

/api/guests?rsvpStatus=ATTENDING

/api/expenses?category=CATERING

/api/vendors?category=PHOTOGRAPHER
```

Do not create endpoints like:

```text
/api/tasks/completed
/api/tasks/pending
/api/tasks/high-priority
```

when filters solve the same problem cleanly.

---

# 92. Sorting

Initial APIs should expose sorting only when needed by actual UI.

We do not need a completely generic:

```text
sortBy
sortDirection
```

system everywhere.

Default sorting should be domain-specific.

Examples:

```text
Events
startsAt ASC

Tasks
dueDate ASC

Guests
createdAt DESC or name ASC

Expenses
expenseDate DESC

Photos
createdAt DESC
```

---

# 93. Search

Basic search is sufficient for V1.

Examples:

### Guests

```text
name
email
phone
```

### Vendors

```text
name
contact person
```

No separate search infrastructure is required.

---

# 94. Request Validation

Every external body/query parameter should pass through Zod.

Example:

```text
POST /api/guests
```

should validate:

```text
name required

valid optional email

maxGuests >= 1

eventIds valid ObjectId strings

phone string length constraints
```

Validation errors should return structured field details.

---

# 95. ObjectId Validation

Never pass malformed Mongo IDs directly to Mongoose queries.

Validate route parameters such as:

```text
eventId
guestId
vendorId
expenseId
membershipId
```

before querying.

Malformed IDs should generally return:

```text
400 VALIDATION_ERROR
```

rather than becoming a database error.

---

# 96. Resource Isolation

For every Wedding-owned authenticated resource:

```text
GET /api/vendors/:vendorId
```

database lookup must include:

```text
vendorId
+
currentWeddingId
```

If the vendor belongs to another Wedding, return:

```text
404 NOT_FOUND
```

rather than:

```text
403
```

This avoids leaking resource existence across tenants.

---

# 97. Admin Authorization

Only these operations require ADMIN:

```text
Invite Wedding Member

Revoke Member Invite

Change Member Role

Remove Member
```

Everything else can be managed by ADMIN and MANAGER.

This should be represented by reusable authorization middleware/helper logic.

---

# 98. Public API Data Minimization

Public APIs should return only what the page requires.

For example:

```text
/api/public/invitations/:token
```

should not expose:

```text
Wedding Members
Guest email unless necessary
Guest notes
Expense data
Vendor contracts
Internal IDs unnecessarily
```

---

# 99. Rate Limiting Targets

At minimum rate limit:

```text
POST /api/auth/login

POST /api/auth/signup

POST /api/auth/forgot-password

POST /api/auth/reset-password

GET /api/public/invitations/:token

POST /api/public/invitations/:token/rsvp

POST /api/public/galleries/:token/upload-url

POST /api/public/galleries/:token/photos
```

Photo upload flows should additionally enforce upload-count and size limits.

---

# 100. CSRF Considerations

Because authenticated APIs use cookies, state-changing authenticated operations require CSRF consideration.

At minimum:

- Use SameSite cookies appropriately
- Validate request Origin/Host for mutation requests
- Do not allow wildcard CORS
- Keep APIs same-origin with the Next.js application

A separate CSRF token mechanism may be added if needed after implementation review.

---

# 101. CORS

For V1:

> Keep the API same-origin.

Do not enable unrestricted cross-origin API access.

This removes unnecessary attack surface.

Future mobile/native applications can introduce explicit CORS/API-authentication changes later.

---

# 102. Idempotency

Not every endpoint needs idempotency keys.

Important areas:

### Bulk Email

Use EmailJob-level idempotency.

### RSVP

Calling RSVP twice with the same state should simply result in the same final state.

### Photo Metadata

The same R2 object should not create duplicate Photo records.

`objectKey UNIQUE` provides protection.

### Wedding Creation

A user already having a Wedding receives a conflict rather than creating another.

---

# 103. External Provider Errors

Do not leak provider-specific errors directly.

Example Google response:

```text
REQUEST_DENIED
```

should be transformed into:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "EXTERNAL_SERVICE_ERROR",
    "message": "Vendor discovery is temporarily unavailable."
  }
}
```

# 108. Important API Tradeoff: Stable Guest Tokens

The earlier database design preferred hashing every secret token.

For sessions and password reset tokens, this remains the correct choice.

However, guest invitation links and gallery links need to be:

- Stable
- Reusable
- Repeatedly shareable by Wedding Members
- Printable in the case of gallery QR

If only a one-way hash is stored, the raw URL cannot later be reconstructed.

Therefore the API/database implementation should make an explicit exception.

Recommended practical V1 decision:

```text
Session Token
→ hash only

Password Reset Token
→ hash only

Wedding Member Invitation Token
→ hash only

Guest Invitation Token
→ high-entropy stable raw token

Gallery Token
→ high-entropy stable raw token
```

Guest/gallery tokens are effectively **unguessable public-share secrets**, similar to many "anyone with the link" products.

They must:

- Have high entropy
- Never be sequential
- Never appear in logs
- Never be exposed in unrelated API responses
- Be rotatable in the future if compromised

This gives us a much cleaner user experience for Copy Link, WhatsApp and QR sharing.

# 110. API Design Xples to Freeze

## Decision 1

**Use REST through Next.js Route Handlers.**

---

## Decision 2

**Private APIs derive Wedding context from the authenticated session.**

Client does not control tenant identity.

---

## Decision 3

**ADMIN and MANAGER share almost all functionality.**

Only Member-management mutations require ADMIN.

---

## Decision 4

**Public Guest APIs use high-entropy token URLs instead of login.**

---

## Decision 5

**Use page-based pagination for admin lists and cursor pagination for photos.**

---

## Decision 6

**Use Zod at every external API boundary.**

---

## Decision 7

**Use consistent application error objects.**

---

## Decision 8

**Use action endpoints only where the operation is genuinely not simple CRUD.**

Examples:

```text
send-invitation
send-reminder
accept
rsvp
```

---

## Decision 9

**Bulk emails return immediately after creating EmailJobs.**

Processing happens asynchronously.

---

## Decision 10

**Photo binaries never flow through normal API endpoints.**

API issues short-lived R2 upload URLs; browser uploads directly.

---

## Decision 11

**External APIs are hidden behind our backend.**

Frontend does not call Google Places directly.

---

## Decision 12

**Cross-Wedding resource access should behave like NOT_FOUND.**

Do not expose existence of another Wedding's resources.

# 112. Next Design Step

With:

```text
PRD
    ↓
System Design
    ↓
Database Design
    ↓
API Design
```

now frozen, the next logical document should be:

# Application / Codebase Architecture

That document should define:

- Next.js folder structure
- Route groups
- Domain module structure
- API route-handler structure
- Services
- Repositories
- Mongoose models
- Zod schemas
- Authentication utilities
- Authorization helpers
- Error classes
- Email abstraction
- Storage abstraction
- Google Places abstraction
- Server/client boundaries
- Naming conventions
- Dependency rules between modules

After that, we can move into **frontend architecture/UI flows**, and then implementation can begin without Codex having to invent foundational architecture while writing code.
## Organiser gallery implementation clarification — 2026-09-18

The first gallery increment implements authenticated Admin/Manager uploads,
browsing, single-photo downloads, and deletion. Public/gallery-token routes,
settings and QR remain deferred.

- Upload requests accept JPEG, PNG and WebP, 1 byte through 10 MiB each. The UI
  selects at most 20 files per batch and uploads sequentially. No videos, SVG,
  HEIC conversion, image editing, or bulk downloads/deletes in this increment.
- The upload API reserves a server-issued staging key and binds its metadata to
  the authenticated wedding and membership. Its PUT URL lasts 10 minutes and
  signs Content-Type and Content-Length. Client bodies never supply weddingId.
- Confirmation uses the documented body, matches the reserved metadata and
  membership, checks actual R2 length/MIME and the image format signature, then
  performs an ETag-conditional server-side copy to a new final key. Reads are
  signed for 15 minutes. Replaying a PUT cannot overwrite a published photo.
  Image signature checking is not full image decoding or malware scanning.
- Confirmation is idempotent, including retries after an ambiguous response.
  A pending upload can be confirmed until 24 hours after its PUT URL expires,
  allowing reauthentication. Deleted uploads cannot be confirmed again.
- Event assignment must reference an active event from the same wedding at
  issuance. Existing photos remain visible if that event is later archived.
- GET `/api/photos`: `limit` defaults to 24, maximum 48; `eventId=other` selects
  unassigned Wedding Memories. Cursor encodes createdAt/_id and the active
  event filter. Response retains `{ data, pagination: { nextCursor } }`, adding
  `total` for the filtered count; each photo also includes mimeType and sizeBytes.
  All queries include weddingId and READY state; pending/deleted rows are hidden.
- GET `/api/photos/:photoId/download` returns `{ data: { url } }`: a newly signed
  R2 GET with attachment Content-Disposition. The browser downloads directly
  from R2; the app does not proxy the photo binary.
- DELETE returns `{ data: { success: true } }` after R2 deletion and metadata
  tombstoning. Storage failures retain metadata and return a retryable error.
- Issuance is limited to 120 requests/member/15 minutes, then 600/wedding/15
  minutes. Unauthenticated, malformed, and invalid-event requests do not consume
  this quota. There is no application-wide photo quota shared by other weddings.
- Private metadata and URL responses use Cache-Control: no-store. Provider
  failures are mapped to a generic storage-unavailable error without logging
  keys, credentials, signed URLs or raw provider responses.
