# My Marriage
## System Design Architecture Document

**Version:** V1  
**Status:** Approved Architecture Baseline  
**Architecture Style:** Modular Monolith  
**Application Type:** Full-stack Web Application

---

# 1. Purpose

This document defines the high-level system architecture for **Make My Marriage**, a collaborative Indian wedding-management platform.

The purpose of this document is to establish:

- Overall architecture
- Major system components
- Application boundaries
- Backend structure
- Authentication and authorization model
- Data ownership and multi-tenancy
- Guest-access architecture
- File-storage architecture
- Email architecture
- Vendor-discovery integration
- Wedding website architecture
- Deployment topology
- Security considerations
- Scaling strategy
- Reliability and failure-handling principles

This document intentionally remains at the **system-design level**.

Detailed:

- MongoDB schemas
- Collection structures
- API request/response contracts
- UI component architecture
- Individual API implementation
- Exact folder structure

will be defined separately.

---

# 2. Architecture Goals

The architecture should prioritize:

1. **Simplicity**
2. **Maintainability**
3. **Fast development**
4. **Clear domain boundaries**
5. **Production readiness**
6. **Low infrastructure overhead**
7. **Reasonable scalability**
8. **Security between weddings**
9. **Excellent mobile guest experience**
10. **Ability to evolve without premature distributed-system complexity**

The architecture should comfortably support approximately:

- Up to 1,000 guests per wedding
- Up to 5,000 photos per wedding
- Thousands of weddings over time

without requiring major architectural changes.

---

# 3. Architecture Principles

## 3.1 Start as a Modular Monolith

The entire product will initially operate as one deployable application.

We will not introduce microservices unless a future scaling or organizational requirement justifies them.

---

## 3.2 Wedding is the Tenant Boundary

The primary unit of isolation is the:

**Wedding**

Almost every private domain object belongs to one wedding.

Examples:

- Events
- Tasks
- Guests
- Vendors
- Expenses
- Photos
- Invitations
- Wedding Members

This rule must be enforced consistently throughout the backend.

---

## 3.3 Explicit APIs

Even though frontend and backend exist inside the same Next.js application, backend functionality should be exposed through clearly designed REST APIs where appropriate.

This creates clean boundaries between:

- UI
- Authentication
- Validation
- Business logic
- Data persistence

---

## 3.4 Guests Require No Accounts

Wedding Guests should never be forced through an authentication flow.

Guest-facing functionality will rely on secure, sufficiently random access tokens.

---

## 3.5 Managed Infrastructure Where Possible

The product should avoid unnecessary infrastructure management.

Managed services will be used for:

- Application hosting
- Database
- Object storage
- Email
- Vendor discovery

---

# 6. Modular Monolith Architecture

Although the entire application is deployed as one application, business functionality should be divided into domain modules.

Conceptually:

```text
Application

├── Auth
├── Wedding
├── Wedding Members
├── Events
├── Tasks
├── Guests
├── Invitations
├── Expenses
├── Vendors
├── Wedding Website
├── Gallery
├── Livestream
└── Email
```

Each module should own its business logic.

For example:

```text
Guests

API Layer
   ↓
Guest Validation
   ↓
Guest Service
   ↓
Guest Persistence
   ↓
MongoDB
```

API route handlers should remain thin.

They should primarily:

1. Parse request
2. Authenticate user where required
3. Validate request
4. Call business service
5. Return HTTP response

Business logic should not become embedded inside individual route files.

---

# 7. Application Surfaces

The product has three fundamentally different application surfaces.

---

## 7.1 Private Wedding Dashboard

Example:

```text
/app/*
```

Requires authenticated Wedding Member access.

Includes:

- Dashboard
- Events
- Tasks
- Guests
- Invitations
- RSVP management
- Expenses
- Vendors
- Wedding website configuration
- Photo management
- Livestream
- Settings
- Wedding Members

---

## 7.2 Public Wedding Website

Example:

```text
/w/akshay-princi-14022027
```

Does not require authentication.

Contains intentionally public wedding information configured by Wedding Members.

Possible sections:

- Couple information
- Wedding date
- Events
- Venues
- Gallery
- Livestream

---

## 7.3 Token-Protected Guest Experience

Examples:

```text
/invite/:token

/gallery/:token
```

No account or login required.

Access is controlled by possession of an unpredictable secret token.

These pages include:

### Invitation

- Guest-specific invitation
- Invited events
- RSVP

### Gallery

- View wedding photos
- Upload wedding photos

---

# 8. Authentication Architecture

Make My Marriage will implement custom email/password authentication.

No external authentication framework will be required for V1.

---

## 8.1 Signup Flow

```text
User
 │
 ▼
POST /api/auth/signup
 │
 ▼
Validate Input
 │
 ▼
Check Existing Email
 │
 ▼
Hash Password
 │
 ▼
Create User
 │
 ▼
Create Session
 │
 ▼
Set Secure Cookie
 │
 ▼
Create Wedding / Join Wedding
```

No email verification is required in V1.

---

# 9. Password Security

Passwords must never be stored directly.

The application should store only a secure password hash using an industry-standard password-hashing library.

Conceptually:

```text
Plain Password
      ↓
Password Hashing Algorithm
      ↓
Password Hash
      ↓
MongoDB
```

Authentication code should never implement cryptographic primitives manually.

---

# 10. Session Architecture

The preferred authentication model is server-side sessions.

Conceptually:

```text
Login
  ↓
Create Session
  ↓
Store session in MongoDB
  ↓
Return random session token
  ↓
Store token in secure cookie
```

Session metadata may include:

```text
sessionId
userId
createdAt
expiresAt
```

Browser cookie should use appropriate protections such as:

- HttpOnly
- Secure
- SameSite

The cookie contains a session identifier rather than trusted authorization information.

---

# 11. Logout

Logout flow:

```text
User
 ↓
POST /api/auth/logout
 ↓
Invalidate Session
 ↓
Delete Session Cookie
```

Sessions should also expire automatically after a defined period.

---

# 12. Password Reset

Password reset still requires email even though email verification does not.

Flow:

```text
Forgot Password
      ↓
Enter Email
      ↓
Generate Secure Reset Token
      ↓
Store Token / Token Hash + Expiry
      ↓
Send Reset Email through Resend
      ↓
User Opens Link
      ↓
Set New Password
      ↓
Invalidate Reset Token
```

Existing active sessions may optionally be invalidated when a password is reset.

---

# 13. Wedding Membership Model

Authenticated users interact with weddings through a membership relationship.

Conceptually:

```text
User
 │
 ▼
WeddingMembership
 │
 ├── weddingId
 └── role
```

Roles:

```text
ADMIN
MANAGER
```

---

# 14. Authorization

Authorization will be intentionally simple.

### Admin

Can perform all wedding-management operations.

Additionally:

- Invite Wedding Members
- Remove Wedding Members
- Change Wedding Member roles

### Manager

Can perform normal wedding-management operations.

Cannot:

- Invite Wedding Members
- Remove Wedding Members
- Modify Wedding Member roles

---

# 15. Authorization Flow

Every private API request should conceptually perform:

```text
Request
   ↓
Authenticate Session
   ↓
Resolve Current User
   ↓
Resolve Wedding Membership
   ↓
Resolve weddingId
   ↓
Check Required Permission
   ↓
Perform Operation
```

Example:

```text
PATCH /api/tasks/:taskId
```

The backend should not simply load:

```text
Task where _id = taskId
```

Instead it should validate that the task belongs to the authenticated user's wedding.

Conceptually:

```text
Task where

_id = taskId
AND
weddingId = currentWeddingId
```

This prevents cross-wedding access.

---

# 16. Multi-Tenancy

Even though users can only participate in one wedding in V1, the application is still multi-tenant.

Each Wedding represents one tenant.

Data isolation must be enforced at the backend.

Example:

```text
Wedding A
 ├── Events
 ├── Tasks
 ├── Guests
 └── Expenses

Wedding B
 ├── Events
 ├── Tasks
 ├── Guests
 └── Expenses
```

Members of Wedding A must never have access to Wedding B data.

Front-end filtering alone is not sufficient.

Isolation must happen in backend queries.

---

# 17. Wedding Creation Flow

```text
New User
   ↓
Authenticated
   ↓
No Wedding Membership Found
   ↓
Create Wedding
   ↓
Create Wedding Membership
   ↓
Role = ADMIN
   ↓
Redirect to Dashboard
```

Creating a wedding and creating its initial membership should happen atomically or with appropriate rollback/error handling.

---

# 18. Wedding Member Invitation Architecture

Admins can invite another person by email.

Example:

```text
rahul@example.com
Role: MANAGER
```

The system creates a Wedding Member Invitation containing information such as:

```text
weddingId
email
role
tokenHash
status
expiresAt
```

---

# 19. Wedding Member Invitation Flow

```text
Admin
  ↓
Invite Email
  ↓
Create Invitation
  ↓
Send Email through Resend
  ↓
Recipient Opens Invite
```

If recipient does not have an account:

```text
Invitation
   ↓
Signup
   ↓
Create User
   ↓
Accept Invitation
   ↓
Create Membership
```

If recipient already has an account:

```text
Invitation
   ↓
Login
   ↓
Accept Invitation
   ↓
Create Membership
```

No email verification is required.

If the user already belongs to another wedding, the invitation should be rejected because V1 supports one wedding per user.

---

# 20. Wedding Member Safety Rules

The backend should prevent:

- Manager inviting another Manager
- Manager changing roles
- Manager removing members
- Wedding ending with zero Admins
- Unauthorized membership modification
- Joining multiple weddings

---

# 21. Guest Architecture

Guests are fundamentally different from Wedding Members.

A guest:

- Has no User account
- Has no password
- Has no session
- Has no application role

A Guest is simply wedding data.

Conceptually:

```text
Wedding
  ↓
Guest
  ↓
Invitation Token
```

---

# 22. Guest Invitation Tokens

Guest URLs should never expose predictable identifiers.

Avoid:

```text
/invite/12345
```

Use:

```text
/invite/Fkm28KmSx92L...
```

The token should have enough entropy that guessing another guest's link is practically infeasible.

V1 uses the deliberate stable-sharing exception in `API_DESIGN.md` §44:
store a high-entropy random invitation token in the Guest document so organisers
can later retrieve the same sharing URL. Exclude it from ordinary queries and all
guest CRUD responses; never log it. This supersedes the earlier optional hash-only
suggestion for guest invitations. Session and member invitation tokens remain
HMAC-hashed under their existing rules.

---

# 23. Guest RSVP Flow

```text
Guest Opens
/invite/:token
      ↓
Validate Token
      ↓
Resolve Guest
      ↓
Load Invited Events
      ↓
Display Invitation
      ↓
Guest Submits RSVP
      ↓
Validate Maximum Guest Count
      ↓
Update RSVP
```

Guest may return to the same link later and modify their RSVP.

Implemented 2026-09-16: Admin/Manager guest details retrieve the stable sharing URL;
public `/invite/:token` and invitation APIs require no account. Guest invitation
services own token resolution, minimal public projections, capacity validation,
repeat-response idempotency, and wedding-scoped summaries. The events repository
loads only active invited events in that wedding. Atomic guest version/capacity
checks prevent lost updates across organiser edits and RSVP submissions.

The public page follows the approved Stitch floral hero, overlapping RSVP status
card, dated itinerary, and formal response form. It retains input on failure and
refreshes permitted details on focus. Generic unavailable states hide deleted or
invalid links. Application logging excludes token-bearing request paths, and
no-store/no-referrer/noindex protections apply. RSVP writes reuse the MongoDB
rate-limit mechanism (300/minute globally; 20 per invitation/15 minutes) with HMAC
counter keys. Token/owner resolution and capacity validation precede quota use;
per-invitation admission precedes shared admission, so invalid links and rejected
per-invitation attempts do not spend shared capacity. Dashboard RSVP groups and
people attending use saved data.
Guest email delivery, bulk actions, reminders, deadlines, individual guest rosters,
dietary preferences, transport, and room allocation are outside this increment.

---

# 24. Gallery Guest Access

Gallery access uses a wedding-level token rather than guest-specific tokens.

Example:

```text
/gallery/7hP3kD9a...
```

This URL may be shared using:

- Wedding website
- WhatsApp
- Printed material
- QR code

Access to this URL allows guests to:

- View wedding photos
- Upload wedding photos

No account is required.

---

# 25. QR Code Architecture

The QR code should simply encode the stable gallery URL.

Example:

```text
https://makemymarriage.com/gallery/7hP3kD9a...
```

The QR image itself does not need to be persisted.

It can be generated whenever an organiser requests it.

This ensures:

- QR remains lightweight
- URL remains stable
- Previously printed QR codes continue to function

---

# 26. Wedding Website Architecture

Each Wedding has a public website.

Example:

```text
/w/akshay-princi-14022027
```

The page resolves the slug to a Wedding.

The website renderer then loads public information such as:

- Couple details
- Wedding date
- Event information
- Theme
- Gallery settings
- Livestream configuration

---

# 27. Wedding Slug Generation

Initial slug generation may use:

```text
brideName-groomName-weddingDate
```

Example:

```text
akshay-princi-14022027
```

Slug generation should:

1. Normalize names
2. Remove unsupported characters
3. Add wedding date
4. Check uniqueness
5. Add suffix if collision exists

Example collision:

```text
akshay-princi-14022027

akshay-princi-14022027-2
```

The slug should remain stable after creation.

Changing:

- Bride name
- Groom name
- Wedding date

should not automatically change an already published URL.

This prevents broken shared links.

---

# 28. Wedding Themes

All themes operate over the same wedding data.

Conceptually:

```text
Wedding Data
     ↓
Theme Selection
     ↓
Theme Renderer
     ↓
Wedding Website
```

Example:

```text
Theme = CLASSIC
Theme = MINIMAL
Theme = MODERN
```

Themes should modify presentation rather than duplicate wedding content.

---

# 29. Event Architecture

Events belong to a Wedding.

Other modules can optionally reference Events.

Conceptually:

```text
Wedding
  ↓
Event
```

Then:

```text
Task ───────→ Event
Guest Invite → Event
Vendor ─────→ Event
Expense ────→ Event
Photo ──────→ Event
```

These associations are optional depending on the entity.

For example, an expense does not necessarily have to belong to an event.

---

# 30. Task Architecture

Tasks belong to the wedding and may reference:

- Assigned Wedding Member
- Wedding Event

The backend should validate that:

- Assigned member belongs to the same Wedding
- Related Event belongs to the same Wedding

This prevents accidental cross-tenant references.

---

# 31. Guest Architecture

Guests belong directly to the Wedding.

A Guest may be associated with several Events.

Conceptually:

```text
Guest
 ├── Wedding
 ├── Invited Events[]
 ├── RSVP Status
 └── Number Attending
```

Individual family members are not modelled.

---

# 32. Expense Architecture

Expenses belong to the Wedding.

Expenses can optionally reference:

```text
Event
Vendor
```

Conceptually:

```text
Expense
 ├── weddingId
 ├── eventId?
 └── vendorId?
```

The Expense Tracker does not implement budgets or payment schedules.

---

# 33. Vendor Architecture

Two different concepts exist:

## My Vendors

Application-owned vendor records saved by Wedding Members.

## Vendor Discovery

External business search powered by Google Places.

---

# 34. Vendor Discovery Flow

```text
Wedding Member
      ↓
Choose Vendor Category
      ↓
Choose Location
      ↓
Next.js Backend
      ↓
Google Places API
      ↓
Return Results
```

The default location should come from the Wedding.

Users should be allowed to modify the search location.

---

# 35. Wedding Location Data

Wedding location should be stored as structured information rather than only free text.

Conceptually:

```text
formattedAddress
city
state
country
latitude
longitude
googlePlaceId
```

Coordinates allow efficient nearby-vendor searches.

---

# 36. Add Discovered Vendor Flow

```text
Google Places Result
        ↓
User clicks
"Add to My Vendors"
        ↓
Extract Relevant Vendor Information
        ↓
Create Internal Vendor Record
        ↓
Vendor now belongs to Wedding
```

After this point, the application's Vendor record should not rely exclusively on Google remaining available.

---

# 37. Photo Storage Architecture

Actual image files should not be stored inside MongoDB.

Architecture:

```text
MongoDB
   ↓
Photo Metadata

Cloudflare R2
   ↓
Actual Image Binary
```

MongoDB may store:

```text
weddingId
eventId
objectKey
fileName
mimeType
size
uploaderType
createdAt
```

Cloudflare R2 stores the physical files.

---

# 38. Why Direct-to-R2 Uploads

Large files should not travel through the Vercel backend if avoidable.

Avoid:

```text
Phone
 ↓
Vercel
 ↓
Cloudflare R2
```

Preferred:

```text
Phone
      ↓
Request Upload Permission
      ↓
Next.js API
      ↓
Generate Signed Upload URL
      ↓
Phone
      ↓
Direct Upload
      ↓
Cloudflare R2
```

---

# 39. Photo Upload Flow

Detailed flow:

```text
Guest / Member
       ↓
POST Request for Upload URL
       ↓
Validate Wedding / Gallery Access
       ↓
Validate File Metadata
       ↓
Generate Signed R2 Upload URL
       ↓
Return URL
       ↓
Browser Uploads Directly to R2
       ↓
Upload Success
       ↓
Notify Backend
       ↓
Create Photo Metadata in MongoDB
```

For authenticated Wedding Members, session authorization is used.

For Guests, gallery token authorization is used.

---

# 40. Upload Security

Guest uploads are anonymous from an account perspective, so upload security is important.

The backend should validate:

- Allowed MIME types
- File extensions where relevant
- Maximum file size
- Number of files per request
- Gallery token validity
- Upload URL expiration

Signed URLs should be short-lived.

Guest should not receive broad bucket permissions.

---

# 41. Photo Moderation

There is no moderation workflow in V1.

Guest upload:

```text
Upload
   ↓
Gallery
```

Wedding Members can delete unwanted photos afterwards.

---

# 42. Photo Download and Viewing

Gallery users should primarily load appropriately optimized images for browsing.

Original files can remain available for downloading if required.

The initial version should avoid building a complicated custom image-processing pipeline.

Image optimization can be improved later depending on:

- Storage use
- Bandwidth
- Gallery performance
- User behaviour

---

# 43. Livestream Architecture

No streaming infrastructure will be built.

Wedding Member enters a YouTube Live URL.

```text
Wedding Settings
      ↓
YouTube URL
      ↓
Validate
      ↓
Store URL / Video Identifier
      ↓
Wedding Website
      ↓
Embedded YouTube Player
```

Make My Marriage is therefore only responsible for displaying the stream.

---

# 44. Email Architecture

Resend will be the external email delivery provider.

Email categories include:

### Authentication

- Password reset

### Wedding Members

- Wedding Member invitation

### Guests

- Wedding invitation
- RSVP reminder

---

# 45. Internal Email Abstraction

The application should have an internal email service.

Conceptually:

```text
Business Module
      ↓
Email Service
      ↓
Resend Adapter
      ↓
Resend API
```

Business code should not call the Resend SDK throughout the application.

This allows:

- Centralized email templates
- Easier testing
- Provider replacement later
- Consistent error handling

---

# 46. Immediate Emails

Some emails should be sent synchronously or close to synchronously.

Examples:

```text
Password Reset

Single Wedding Member Invitation

Single Guest Invitation
```

These operations do not justify background infrastructure.

---

# 47. Bulk Email Problem

A wedding may contain up to approximately:

```text
1,000 Guests
```

If Admin chooses:

```text
Send Invitations to All Guests
```

the application should not attempt hundreds of provider calls inside the user-facing request.

---

# 48. Lightweight Background Email Architecture

Rather than:

- Redis
- BullMQ
- RabbitMQ
- Kafka
- Dedicated worker server

V1 will use:

```text
MongoDB
+
Vercel Cron
+
Small Resend Batches
```

---

# 49. Email Job Flow

```text
Admin
  ↓
Send Invitations to 700 Guests
  ↓
Next.js API
  ↓
Create Email Jobs
  ↓
Return Success to User
```

Background:

```text
Vercel Cron
    ↓
Protected Processing Endpoint
    ↓
Fetch Pending Email Jobs
    ↓
Lock / Mark Processing
    ↓
Process Small Batch
    ↓
Resend
    ↓
Update Job Status
```

---

# 50. Email Job States

Conceptually:

```text
PENDING

PROCESSING

SENT

FAILED
```

Useful metadata:

```text
attempts
lastAttemptAt
errorMessage
sentAt
```

Exact schema belongs in database design.

---

# 51. Batch Size

The system should intentionally use small batches.

For example:

```text
25–50 emails
```

per processing cycle.

Exact values should remain configurable.

This protects:

- Server execution limits
- Email provider rate limits
- Application reliability

---

# 52. Email Retries

Failed email jobs may be retried a limited number of times.

Example:

```text
Attempt 1
   ↓ Fail

Attempt 2
   ↓ Fail

Attempt 3
   ↓ Fail

Mark FAILED
```

Retries should not continue forever.

The application should avoid duplicate delivery through careful job-state handling and provider-level idempotency where available.

---

# 53. Concurrency Protection for Background Jobs

If two cron executions overlap, the same email should not be sent twice.

Therefore workers need a safe claiming mechanism.

Conceptually:

```text
PENDING
   ↓ atomic claim
PROCESSING
```

Only one processor should successfully claim a particular job.

Detailed MongoDB implementation will be decided later.

---

# 54. Vercel Cron

Vercel Cron will periodically call an internal route.

Conceptually:

```text
/api/internal/jobs/email
```

This endpoint must not be publicly executable without authorization.

It should require a secret known only to the application/cron environment.

---

# 55. Database Connection Architecture

MongoDB Atlas will be accessed through Mongoose.

The application should reuse database connections across requests where runtime behaviour permits.

Avoid:

```text
Request
 ↓
Open New Mongo Connection
 ↓
Query
 ↓
Close
```

Instead use a reusable connection abstraction.

Conceptually:

```text
Application
      ↓
Mongo Connection Manager
      ↓
Connection Pool
      ↓
MongoDB Atlas
```

---

# 56. Database Design Philosophy

The exact database model is outside this document, but several rules are already established.

Do not create one giant embedded Wedding document.

Avoid:

```text
Wedding {
  thousandsOfGuests: [...],
  thousandsOfPhotos: [...],
  allTasks: [...],
  allExpenses: [...]
}
```

Instead major entities should generally have separate collections.

Examples:

```text
users
sessions
weddings
wedding_memberships
member_invitations

events
tasks

guests
guest_invitations

vendors
expenses

photos

email_jobs
```

Exact naming and structure will be decided during database design.

---

# 57. API Architecture

The application will use REST APIs.

Examples:

```text
/api/auth/*

/api/wedding/*

/api/members/*

/api/events/*

/api/tasks/*

/api/guests/*

/api/invitations/*

/api/expenses/*

/api/vendors/*

/api/gallery/*

/api/livestream/*
```

Public APIs may live under:

```text
/api/public/*
```

Internal infrastructure endpoints may live under:

```text
/api/internal/*
```

---

# 58. API Layer Responsibilities

Route handlers should perform:

```text
Authentication
Authorization
Input parsing
Zod validation
Calling services
Mapping errors
Returning HTTP responses
```

They should not contain complicated business rules.

---

# 59. Service Layer Responsibilities

Business service modules should contain:

- Domain rules
- Permission-independent business validation
- Cross-entity validation
- Workflow coordination
- Repository/database operations

Example:

```text
GuestService.createGuest()

TaskService.assignTask()

WeddingService.createWedding()

InvitationService.submitRSVP()

GalleryService.createUploadPermission()
```

---

# 60. Validation Strategy

Zod will validate external inputs.

Examples:

- Signup payload
- Event creation
- Task creation
- Guest creation
- RSVP submission
- Expense creation
- Vendor creation

Validation should happen at the system boundary.

Mongoose schemas should additionally protect database integrity.

These layers serve different purposes.

---

# 61. Error Handling

Errors should eventually map into consistent categories.

Examples:

```text
VALIDATION_ERROR

UNAUTHENTICATED

FORBIDDEN

NOT_FOUND

CONFLICT

RATE_LIMITED

INTERNAL_ERROR
```

API responses should not expose internal stack traces to users.

---

# 62. Logging

V1 intentionally uses simple logging.

Sources:

- Application logs
- Vercel runtime logs
- MongoDB Atlas operational information when required

Important failures should be logged with useful context.

Example:

```text
requestId
userId
weddingId
operation
error
```

Sensitive information such as passwords and tokens should never be logged.

---

# 63. No External Observability Platform in MVP

V1 will not initially introduce:

- Sentry
- Datadog
- New Relic
- PostHog

These can be introduced later once usage justifies them.

The architecture should not prevent adding them later.

---

# 64. Security Architecture

Security is particularly important because weddings contain private family information and guest data.

Primary areas:

1. Authentication security
2. Authorization
3. Tenant isolation
4. Guest-token security
5. Upload security
6. Input validation
7. Rate limiting
8. Secret management
9. External API security

---

# 65. API Authorization

Private routes must require a valid authenticated session.

Protected services must never trust:

```text
weddingId supplied by frontend
```

as proof of access.

Wedding identity should be derived from the authenticated membership.

---

# 66. Object-Level Authorization

Consider:

```text
PATCH /api/events/123
```

The existence of event `123` is not enough.

Backend should verify:

```text
event._id = 123

AND

event.weddingId = currentWeddingId
```

This rule applies to:

- Events
- Tasks
- Guests
- Vendors
- Expenses
- Photos
- Other wedding-owned resources

---

# 67. Rate Limiting

The most sensitive endpoints for rate limiting include:

```text
POST /api/auth/login

POST /api/auth/signup

POST /api/auth/forgot-password

POST /api/public/invite/:token/rsvp

POST /api/public/gallery/:token/upload-request
```

The first version can use a lightweight mechanism appropriate to Vercel without introducing a large infrastructure dependency.

Rate-limiting architecture can evolve separately from core business services.

---

# 68. Secret Management

Sensitive credentials must exist only in server-side environment configuration.

Examples:

```text
MongoDB URI

R2 credentials

Resend API key

Google Places key

Session secret

Cron secret
```

These values must never be exposed in browser bundles.

---

# 69. Google Places Security

Google Places requests should primarily originate from the backend.

Flow:

```text
Browser
  ↓
Make My Marriage API
  ↓
Google Places API
```

This allows:

- Credential protection
- Request validation
- Centralized API usage
- Potential caching later

---

# 70. File Security

Cloudflare R2 bucket access should not simply make every uploaded image publicly writable.

Uploads should use narrowly scoped, expiring signed URLs.

Private gallery behaviour should be respected when deciding how objects are served.

---

# 71. Data Privacy

Private wedding-management information should only be available to Wedding Members.

Guest invitation pages expose only information relevant to that invitation.

Public wedding website exposes only intentionally published information.

Gallery exposes only content intended for gallery participants.

---

# 72. Performance Strategy

V1 should focus on straightforward optimizations rather than advanced distributed caching.

Primary techniques:

- Proper MongoDB indexes
- Pagination
- Connection reuse
- Direct file uploads
- Optimized image delivery
- Efficient API queries
- Small email batches

---

# 73. Pagination

Large collections should never assume all data can be loaded indefinitely in one request.

Likely candidates:

- Guests
- Photos
- Tasks
- Expenses
- Vendors

Example:

```text
GET /api/guests?page=1&limit=50
```

Exact pagination style can be determined during API design.

---

# 74. MongoDB Indexing

Indexes will be important for:

```text
weddingId

email

session token/hash

guest invitation token/hash

gallery token/hash

wedding slug

event date

task due date

RSVP status

email job status
```

Composite indexes should be defined according to actual query patterns during database design.

---

# 75. Caching

No dedicated Redis caching layer is required initially.

We should first rely on:

- Efficient MongoDB queries
- Next.js caching where clearly appropriate
- Browser/CDN caching for static assets

Caching should be introduced only when measurable performance needs justify it.

---

# 76. Realtime Updates

V1 will not implement:

- WebSockets
- Server-Sent Events
- Live multi-user collaboration

If one Manager updates a task, another Manager may see the new value when:

- navigating
- refreshing
- triggering normal refetching

This is acceptable for the first version.

---

# 77. Deployment Architecture

Production deployment:

```text
                         Internet
                            │
                            ▼
                        Vercel

                                                 │
                                                 ▼
                                               Email

                            │
                            ▼
                    Google Places API
```

---

# 78. Environment Separation

At minimum, the application should distinguish:

```text
Local Development

Production
```

A staging environment can be introduced once needed.

Each environment should ideally have isolated credentials.

At minimum, production data must not accidentally be used during local development.

---

# 79. Deployment Simplicity

There is no:

- Dedicated backend server
- Kubernetes
- ECS
- Docker requirement
- Load balancer configuration
- Manual Node cluster
- Microservice deployment

Vercel manages application runtime and HTTP scaling.

---

# 80. Scaling Strategy

The system should follow an incremental scaling strategy.

---

## Stage 1

Initial launch.

```text
Next.js
MongoDB Atlas
R2
Resend
Google Places
```

No additional infrastructure.

---

## Stage 2

Increasing usage.

Optimize:

- Mongo indexes
- Query design
- Pagination
- R2 delivery
- Email batching
- API rate limits

---

## Stage 3

Significant scale.

Only then consider:

- Dedicated job queue
- Redis
- Specialized worker service
- More advanced image processing
- CDN changes
- Read-heavy caching
- Search infrastructure

---

# 81. Failure Handling

The system must assume external services can fail.

Examples:

- MongoDB temporarily unavailable
- Resend API error
- Google Places unavailable
- R2 upload failure
- YouTube link invalid

Failures should degrade gracefully where possible.

---

# 82. Resend Failure

If a single transactional email fails:

```text
Request
 ↓
Resend Failure
 ↓
Return Appropriate Error
 ↓
Allow Retry
```

For bulk email:

```text
Email Job
 ↓
Failure
 ↓
Retry
 ↓
Eventually FAILED
```

---

# 83. R2 Upload Failure

If direct upload fails:

- Do not create completed Photo metadata
- Allow guest/user to retry
- Display clear upload failure state

If an object uploads successfully but metadata creation fails, the system may temporarily have an orphaned object.

A future cleanup mechanism can remove old orphaned uploads if required.

---

# 84. Google Places Failure

Vendor Discovery should fail independently.

Example:

```text
"Vendor discovery is temporarily unavailable."
```

Existing wedding-management functionality should remain fully usable.

---

# 85. YouTube Failure

An invalid or unavailable livestream must not break the wedding website.

Instead hide the player or show an appropriate fallback.

---

# 86. Data Consistency

MongoDB transactions should be considered only where multiple related writes must succeed together.

Examples:

### Create Wedding

```text
Create Wedding
+
Create Initial Admin Membership
```

### Accept Member Invitation

```text
Create Membership
+
Mark Invitation Accepted
```

Not every operation requires a transaction.

---

# 87. Soft Delete vs Hard Delete

This should be decided per domain during database design.

Examples:

Tasks may be hard deleted.

Wedding Members may require stronger historical handling.

Photos may require R2 deletion plus metadata deletion.

Weddings themselves may eventually require soft deletion to protect against accidental complete data loss.

The V1 database design should explicitly decide this for major entities.

---

# 88. External Dependencies

The system relies on:

### MongoDB Atlas

Primary application data.

### Cloudflare R2

Wedding media.

### Resend

Email.

### Google Places

Vendor discovery.

### YouTube

Livestream embedding.

### Vercel

Application hosting and cron execution.

The application should minimize unnecessary coupling to these providers by using internal abstractions where valuable.

---

# 89. Internal Integration Abstractions

Recommended internal service boundaries:

```text
EmailService
   ↓
Resend

StorageService
   ↓
Cloudflare R2

VendorDiscoveryService
   ↓
Google Places
```

This avoids leaking third-party SDKs throughout business logic.

---

# 90. Testing Considerations

Detailed testing strategy belongs in another document, but architecture should support:

### Unit Tests

Business services and utility logic.

### Integration Tests

API + database behaviour.

### Authorization Tests

Cross-wedding isolation.

### Guest Token Tests

Invitation/gallery security.

### End-to-End Tests

Critical journeys such as:

```text
Signup
→ Create Wedding
→ Add Event
→ Add Guest
→ Send Invite
→ RSVP
```

---

# 91. Critical Security Tests

Testing must explicitly cover:

```text
Wedding A user cannot fetch Wedding B event.

Wedding A Manager cannot modify Wedding B task.

Manager cannot manage Wedding Members.

Guest token cannot expose another guest.

Guest cannot exceed allowed attendee count.

Invalid gallery token cannot upload.

Expired reset token cannot reset password.
```

---

# 92. Important Architectural Decisions

## ADR-01: Modular Monolith

**Decision:** Build one application rather than microservices.

**Reason:** Product complexity does not justify distributed infrastructure.

---

## ADR-02: Next.js Full-Stack

**Decision:** Use Next.js for frontend and backend.

**Reason:** Avoid unnecessary separate Express/Nest application while retaining explicit REST endpoints.

---

## ADR-03: MongoDB Atlas

**Decision:** Use MongoDB Atlas with Mongoose.

**Reason:** Fits product preference, document-oriented data and managed production infrastructure.

---

## ADR-04: Custom Authentication

**Decision:** Build email/password auth internally.

**Reason:** Maintain control and educational clarity without introducing Better Auth, Clerk or Auth0.

**Constraint:** Use established password hashing and secure session practices rather than custom cryptography.

---

## ADR-05: No Email Verification

**Decision:** Users can immediately create/join weddings after signup.

**Reason:** Reduce friction and MVP complexity.

---

## ADR-06: Wedding-Level Multi-Tenancy

**Decision:** Wedding acts as tenant boundary.

**Reason:** Almost all private product information logically belongs to a Wedding.

---

## ADR-07: Cloudflare R2

**Decision:** Store actual media files in R2.

**Reason:** Avoid storing large binary media inside MongoDB and support direct uploads.

---

## ADR-08: Guest Token Access

**Decision:** Guests do not authenticate.

**Reason:** Keep RSVP and photo sharing frictionless.

---

## ADR-09: Resend

**Decision:** Use Resend as email provider.

**Reason:** Simple transactional email integration suitable for V1.

---

## ADR-10: MongoDB-Backed Email Jobs

**Decision:** Use MongoDB + Vercel Cron + small batches.

**Reason:** Avoid Redis and dedicated job infrastructure for the initial scale.

---

## ADR-11: Google Places Vendor Discovery

**Decision:** Do not build a proprietary vendor marketplace.

**Reason:** Google Places provides sufficient vendor discovery for V1.

---

## ADR-12: Vercel Hosting

**Decision:** Deploy the Next.js monolith on Vercel.

**Reason:** Low operational overhead and native Next.js support.

---

# 93. Architecture Explicitly Excluded from V1

We will not use:

- Microservices
- Separate Express backend
- NestJS
- GraphQL
- Kafka
- RabbitMQ
- Redis initially
- BullMQ initially
- WebSockets
- Server-Sent Events
- Kubernetes
- ECS
- Docker-based production deployment
- Elasticsearch
- Better Auth
- Clerk
- Auth0
- Email verification
- Photo moderation
- Dedicated image-processing service
- External observability platform
- Product analytics platform

---

# 94. Final System Summary

Make My Marriage V1 will operate as a **TypeScript modular monolith built using Next.js**, with the same application serving the user interface and explicit REST backend APIs.

Authenticated bride, groom and family members will interact through server-side sessions and secure cookies. Every Wedding represents an isolated application tenant.

Guests will interact without accounts through unpredictable invitation and gallery tokens.

MongoDB Atlas will persist application data using Mongoose, while Cloudflare R2 will store wedding photos through direct signed uploads.

Resend will deliver transactional email. Larger invitation/reminder campaigns will use a lightweight MongoDB-backed email-job mechanism processed in small batches through Vercel Cron.

Google Places will provide local vendor discovery, while selected vendors are stored as normal internal Vendor records.

Wedding websites will be rendered by Next.js using stable slugs and predefined themes.

YouTube will provide livestream infrastructure, with Make My Marriage only embedding the configured stream.

The entire application will deploy to Vercel without additional servers, containers, queues, cache clusters, or microservices.

The system is deliberately optimized for:

> **Simple architecture, strong domain boundaries, secure wedding isolation, low operational overhead and enough scalability to support a real publicly available wedding-management product.**

## Organiser gallery storage implementation — 2026-09-18

`src/modules/photos` owns schemas, the Photo model, wedding-scoped persistence,
and gallery use cases. `src/server/storage/r2.ts` owns R2 signing and object
operations. The AWS S3 client and S3 request presigner are added for the immediate
need to use R2's S3-compatible API; no external queue or service is introduced.

The private adapter uses server-only R2_ACCOUNT_ID, R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID,
R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY and R2_BUCKET_NAME. R2_PUBLIC_BASE_URL is unused. Existing
CORS needs only Content-Type for browser PUTs (Content-Length is set by the
browser), plus GET/PUT/HEAD methods and the allowed app origins. Never expose
credentials or publicise the bucket. Development and production use separate
bucket-scoped credentials; Preview deployments still require their own setup.

The browser uploads directly to a staging key. The server verifies length, MIME,
and a 16-byte format signature, pinning inspection and copying to the same ETag.
R2 copies into an independent final key, then MongoDB atomically publishes the
row. Neither the upload body nor downloaded originals pass through an app API.
See the API and database lifecycle clarifications for retry and deletion rules.

The initial browser uses lazy-loaded originals with cursor pagination, and
un-cropped originals in the viewer. Thumbnail derivatives/image optimisation
remain deferred: browsing can download up to 10 MiB per image. Signed private
photos deliberately bypass Next's public image optimiser/cache. The general
recommendation above to optimise gallery images remains follow-up work, not a
claim about this first implementation. Cleanup/reconciliation of abandoned
objects also remains follow-up work.

Selected files and partial results remain in memory across session expiry in the
same tab; confirmation can retry after signing in again. An identity/wedding
change discards that draft. Refreshing/closing the tab cannot restore File objects;
the existing unsaved-changes guard warns before navigation. No persistent file
cache is stored in localStorage.

Verification: `npm test` uses mocked persistence/storage and component tests.
`RUN_R2_SMOKE=1 npm test -- src/server/storage/r2.integration.test.ts` explicitly
loads `.env.local`, refuses any bucket other than make-my-marriage-dev, and
uploads/reads/deletes only a unique test-fixtures prefix. It never uses MongoDB.
