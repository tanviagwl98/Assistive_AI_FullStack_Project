**Product Type:** Web Application  
**Primary Market:** Indian Weddings

---

# 1. Product Overview

## 1.1 Product Name

**Make My Marriage**

## 1.2 Product Vision

Make My Marriage is a digital wedding management platform that helps couples and their families collaboratively plan and manage an Indian wedding from one place.

Indian weddings involve multiple events, dozens of tasks, many family members, hundreds of guests, vendors, expenses, invitations, photos, and several moving pieces.

Most families currently manage this using a combination of:

- WhatsApp groups
- Excel sheets
- Notes
- Phone calls
- Google Docs
- Paper lists
- Different vendor conversations
- Shared photo folders

Make My Marriage brings these activities together inside one structured wedding workspace.

The product should feel like:

> **The operating system for managing an Indian wedding.**

---

# 2. Problem Statement

Planning an Indian wedding is collaborative but highly fragmented.

A typical wedding may involve:

- Bride and groom
- Parents
- Siblings
- Cousins
- Friends
- Multiple wedding events
- Hundreds of guests
- Multiple vendors
- Many expenses
- Invitations and RSVPs
- Wedding photos
- Livestream requirements
- Constant coordination

There is usually no single source of truth.

One family member tracks guests in Excel.

Someone else tracks expenses.

Tasks are discussed inside WhatsApp groups.

Vendor details are stored in individual phones.

Invitations are shared separately.

Wedding photos get scattered across dozens of devices after the wedding.

Make My Marriage aims to solve this by providing one central wedding workspace.

---

# 3. Target Users

## 3.1 Primary Users

The primary users are:

- Bride
- Groom
- Parents
- Siblings
- Close family members
- Trusted friends helping organize the wedding

These users will create accounts and access the wedding management dashboard.

They will collectively be called:

**Wedding Members**

---

# 4. User Types

There are only three user types in V1.

## 4.1 Admin

Admin has access to the entire wedding workspace.

Admin can:

- Manage wedding information
- Create and manage events
- Create and manage tasks
- Manage guests
- Send invitations
- Track RSVP
- Manage expenses
- Manage vendors
- Discover vendors
- Manage wedding website
- Manage gallery
- Upload photos
- Configure livestream
- Manage Wedding Members

The key difference between Admin and Manager is:

> **Only Admin can manage other Wedding Members.**

Multiple Admins should be supported.

For example:

- Bride: Admin
- Groom: Admin

---

## 4.2 Manager

Managers are family members or trusted people helping organize the wedding.

Managers can access almost everything an Admin can.

Managers cannot:

- Add Wedding Members
- Remove Wedding Members
- Change another member's role

Everything else remains accessible.

---

## 4.3 Guest

Guests do not have accounts.

Guests do not log in.

Guests interact with Make My Marriage using secure unique links.

A guest may:

- Open their wedding invitation
- View events they are invited to
- RSVP
- Specify how many people are attending
- View wedding information
- View the private wedding gallery
- Upload wedding photos

---

Wedding Members can maintain the wedding guest list.

## Guest Fields

- Name
- Email

- RSVP status
- Number attending
- Notes

A guest represents one invitation rather than every individual family member.

Example:

Maximum guests allowed: 4

Rajesh may respond:

**Attending with 3 people**

The other three family members do not require separate records.

---

# 9.8 Event-Level Invitations

A guest may be invited to only selected wedding events.

Example:

Rajesh Sharma:

- Haldi: No
- Cocktail: Yes
- Wedding: Yes

The invitation page should only display events that the particular guest is invited to.

---

# 9.9 Invitation Links

Every guest should receive a secure unique invitation link.

Example:

`makemymarriage.com/invite/X7K29P`

The link should identify:

- Wedding
- Guest
- Events guest is invited to

Guests should not be required to log in.

Links should use sufficiently unpredictable tokens so guests cannot easily guess another person's invitation URL.

---

# 9.10 Digital Invitation

The invitation experience should display:

- Invited events
- Event dates
- Event times
- Venues

Wedding Members should be able to identify guests whose RSVP status is still Pending.

The system should provide an option such as:

**Send Reminder**

**Send Reminder to Pending Guests**

The reminder is sent through email.

Automated scheduled reminder workflows are not necessary for the first implementation.

---

# 9.14 WhatsApp Sharing

The product should provide a:

**Share on WhatsApp**

button.

The button opens WhatsApp with a pre-filled message containing the guest's invitation URL.

No WhatsApp API integration is required.

Make My Marriage does not automatically send WhatsApp messages in V1.

---

# 9.15 Expense Tracker

The Expense Tracker records money already spent or committed for the wedding.

It is not a budgeting system.

**My Vendors**

Make My Marriage itself does not process vendor bookings or payments.

---

# 9.18 Wedding Website

Each wedding should have a hosted wedding website.

Example:

`makemymarriage.com/w/tanvi-X`

The wedding website is different from the private guest invitation.

It contains general wedding information.

## Website Sections

### Hero

- Couple names
- Wedding date
- Cover photo

### Welcome

- Optional description

### Events

- Event name
- Date
- Time
- Venue
- Dress code
- Map link

### Gallery

Display wedding photos if gallery sharing is enabled.

### Livestream

Display YouTube livestream if configured.

---

# 9.19 Wedding Website Themes

Users should not manually design their website.

Instead they select from approximately three predefined themes.

Example themes:

### Classic Indian

Traditional, decorative wedding aesthetic.

### Minimal Elegant

Clean typography and elegant layout.

### Modern Celebration

Contemporary, colourful design.

All themes use the same underlying wedding information.

Changing the theme should change presentation rather than content.

---

# 9.20 Wedding Photo Gallery

Each wedding has a private gallery.

The gallery should not be publicly searchable.

Wedding Members can:

- Upload photos
- View photos
- Delete photos
- Share gallery link
- Download photos

Guests with the gallery link can:

- View photos
- Upload photos

Guest deletion permissions are not required.

---

# 9.21 Gallery Albums

Photos should optionally be grouped by wedding event.

Example:

- Haldi
- Sangeet
- Wedding
- Reception

When uploading photos, organisers or guests may select the associated event.

An additional general category can exist:

**Other / Wedding Memories**

---

# 9.22 Guest Photo Upload

Guests should be able to upload wedding photos without authentication.

The upload experience should be designed primarily for mobile devices.

Flow:

1. Guest opens gallery/upload link.
2. Guest selects photos from phone.
3. Guest optionally chooses event.
4. Guest uploads photos.
5. Photos appear in the wedding gallery.

Because uploads happen without authentication, appropriate technical safeguards such as file type validation, size restrictions, upload limits, and secure upload URLs should be implemented during technical design.

---

# 9.23 Wedding QR Code

Each wedding should have a QR code that opens the guest gallery/upload experience.

Example printed message:

**Share the Memories 📸**

Scan to upload and view photos from Tanvi & X's wedding.

Wedding Members should be able to:

- View QR code
- Download QR code
- Print/share QR code

The QR code should use a stable URL so previously printed QR codes continue working.

---

# 9.24 YouTube Livestream

Wedding Members should be able to configure a YouTube livestream.

They provide:

- YouTube Live URL

The wedding website displays the embedded player when configured.

No video streaming infrastructure should be built by Make My Marriage.

Wedding Members should be able to:

- Add livestream
- Update livestream URL
- Remove livestream

---

# 9.25 Settings

Settings should include several simple sections.

## Wedding Details

Edit:

- Bride name
- Groom name

Manage:

- Admins
- Managers

---

- Guest List
- Invitations
- RSVP

**Expenses**

**Vendors**
- My Vendors
- Discover Vendors

**Wedding Website**

**Photos**

**Live Stream**

**Settings**

---

# 11. Important Product Relationships

At the product level, the major relationships are:

```text
User
  |
Wedding Membership
  |
Wedding
  |
  +-- Wedding Members
  |
  +-- Events
  |     |
  |     +-- Tasks
  |     +-- Guests
  |     +-- Vendors
  |     +-- Expenses
  |     +-- Photos
  |
  +-- Tasks
  |
  +-- Guests
  |     |
  |     +-- Invitations
  |     +-- RSVP
  |
  +-- Vendors
  |
  +-- Expenses
  |
  +-- Wedding Website
  |
  +-- Gallery
  |     |
  |     +-- Photos
  |
  +-- Livestream
```

Exact database modelling will be decided during database design.

---

# 12. Important UX Xples

## 12.1 Wedding First

Every logged-in page should clearly feel connected to the current wedding.

The user should see the couple identity or wedding identity consistently.

## 12.2 Simple Enough for Parents

The dashboard should not feel like enterprise project-management software.

A parent who is not technically sophisticated should still be comfortable:

- Adding a guest
- Completing a task
- Recording an expense
- Viewing an RSVP

## 12.3 Mobile Friendly

Although Wedding Members may use desktop dashboards, many workflows will happen from mobile devices.

Guest experiences especially must be mobile-first.

Important mobile workflows:

- RSVP
- Invitation viewing
- Photo upload
- Gallery browsing
- WhatsApp sharing

## 12.4 Minimal Guest Friction

Guests should never be asked to:

- Create account
- Set password
- Install app

Invitation link → RSVP.

QR scan → Gallery.

That should be the philosophy.

## 12.5 Indian Context

The application should feel designed for Indian weddings rather than being a generic event management platform.

Examples:

- Mehendi
- Haldi
- Sangeet
- Roka
- Multiple events
- Family organisers
- WhatsApp sharing
- INR formatting
- Large guest counts

---

# 13. Privacy and Security Expectations

Although detailed security architecture belongs in system design, the product requires the following behaviour.

### Authenticated Data

Wedding management data should only be accessible by Wedding Members.

### Guest Invitation Links

Invitation tokens should be difficult to guess.

### Gallery Links

Private galleries should not be publicly indexed or discoverable.

### Photo Upload

Guest uploads must be securely handled and validated.

### Cross-Wedding Isolation

A user belonging to one wedding must never be able to access another wedding's internal data.

This becomes a critical backend requirement even though each user only participates in one wedding in V1.

---

# 14. Error and Edge Cases

The product should account for situations such as:

### Wedding Member

- Invited email already has an account.
- Invitation expires.
- Admin removes a Manager.
- Multiple Admins exist.
- Admin attempts to remove the final Admin.

The system should never allow a wedding to have zero Admins.

### Guests

- Guest opens expired/invalid link.
- Guest submits RSVP twice.
- Guest changes their RSVP.
- Guest tries to RSVP for more people than allowed.
- Guest has no email address.

Guests without email can still have a link manually shared through WhatsApp.

### Events

- Event occurs after primary wedding date.
- Event has no venue.
- Event is deleted after guests were invited.

The UI should warn the organiser before destructive actions that affect invitations.

### Vendors

- Vendor exists without an expense.
- Expense exists without a vendor.

Both should be valid.

### Gallery

- Guest uploads unsupported file.
- Upload fails midway.
- File exceeds maximum size.
- Guest scans QR after wedding.

The gallery should continue functioning after the wedding unless disabled.

---

# 15. Suggested V1 Success Metrics

Since this is intended to become a real product, some basic product metrics should eventually be tracked.

## Activation

Percentage of users who:

1. Sign up
2. Create wedding
3. Create first event

## Wedding Setup Completion

Percentage of weddings that have:

- At least one event
- At least one task
- At least one guest

## Collaboration

Average number of Wedding Members per wedding.

## Invitations

- Invitations created

- Invitation open rate
- RSVP response rate

## Task Management

Percentage of wedding tasks completed.

## Vendor Usage

- Vendors added
- Vendor discovery searches

## Gallery Engagement

- Photos uploaded
- Guest uploads
- Gallery visitors
- QR visits

These metrics do not necessarily need to appear inside the user-facing product.

---

# 16. Product Release Strategy

Even though all features belong to the V1 product vision, implementation should happen incrementally.

## Phase 1: Foundation

- Authentication

## Phase 6: Memories

- Gallery
- Guest photo uploads

- Private sharing
- QR code

## Phase 7: Production Readiness

### AI Wedding Assistant

A future AI layer could understand the entire wedding workspace.

Examples:

**"Which important wedding tasks are delayed?"**

**"Create a checklist for my Haldi ceremony."**

**"I have 300 guests. Suggest things I may have forgotten."**

**"Summarize my upcoming payments and vendors."**

AI should eventually enhance the actual product data rather than simply adding a generic chatbot.

---

# 18. V1 Product Definition

Make My Marriage V1 is considered functionally complete when:

> A bride or groom can create a wedding, invite family members to collaboratively manage it, create wedding events, manage tasks, maintain guests, send invitations, collect RSVPs, track expenses, manage and discover vendors, publish a themed wedding website, embed a YouTube livestream, and privately collect and share wedding photos through links and QR codes, while guests can participate without creating accounts.

---

# 19. Product Xple

Whenever deciding whether something belongs in V1, use this question:

> **Does this feature directly help a family plan, coordinate, celebrate, or preserve their wedding?**

If yes, consider it.

If it introduces significant complexity without meaningfully improving the core wedding-management experience, defer it.

The objective of V1 is not to build every possible wedding-related feature.

The objective is to build a cohesive product that a real Indian family could genuinely use for their wedding.
